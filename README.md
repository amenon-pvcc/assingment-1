    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Government censorship of the internet is a growing concern in many parts of the world. While some governments justify censorship as a means to protect national security, it raises important questions about freedom of speech, access to information, and citizens' rights. This website explores these issues, providing insight into the balance between security and freedom, and how different nations handle these challenges.</p>

  <section id="why-censorship">
    <h2>Why Do Governments Censor the Internet?</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why governments may restrict or censor internet access. Some of the most common include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>National Security:</strong> Governments may censor certain websites or platforms to prevent terrorism, cyber attacks, or the spread of extremist ideologies.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Stability:</strong> Some nations restrict access to avoid social unrest or the dissemination of information that could incite protests or violence.</li>
      <li><strong>Political Control:</strong> In authoritarian regimes, internet censorship is often used to suppress dissent and limit access to foreign media or political opposition.</li>
      <li><strong>Moral Reasons:</strong> Some countries block access to content deemed harmful to cultural or religious values, such as pornography or violent media.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="national-security">
    <h2>Censorship for National Security</h2>
    <p>In some cases, governments claim that restricting internet access is necessary for national security. This often involves preventing the spread of misinformation, combating cyber threats, and avoiding terrorist recruitment online. However, there is a fine line between genuine security concerns and using national security as an excuse for political control.</p>

  <section id="ethical-implications">
    <h2>Ethical Implications of Internet Censorship</h2>
    <p>Internet censorship raises serious ethical questions, particularly in democratic societies. While protecting citizens from harm is important, limiting access to information can also stifle free expression and violate human rights. Below are some ethical issues related to internet censorship:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Freedom of Speech: Does censorship infringe on the right to express opinions and access diverse viewpoints?</li>
      <li>Transparency: Are governments being transparent about their reasons for censorship?</li>
      <li>Abuse of Power: Can censorship be misused to silence opposition or control public discourse?</li>
    </ol>
